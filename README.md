# MyPokeBot - PokeBot
Safest, Friendliest, and overall Best Pokemon Go Bot

Project website: http://www.mypokebot.com

This bot for Pokemon Go was written by an experienced team that developed bots and utilities for so many other games.


## Bot features:

1) Start at any location that you wish.

2) Walks to PokeStops and Pokemons around the area (you can set the walking speed as you like)

3) Collects PokeStops loot and catches all the Pokemon.

4) Adjust you backpack item count to keep only enough items of each (for example, no more than 30 pokeballs needed).

5) Will automatically evolve pokemon that have enough candies to evolve.

6) Automatically send duplicate Pokemons with lower combat power (CP) to the professor.

7) Automatically incubate and hatch eggs.


Every one of the above features can be configured/disabled.

Basically you should be able to achieve 2000+ cp pokemon within 24 hours with correct settings.
